### Full TokenScript Support

With TokenScript, you can extend your Token’s capabilities to become "smart" and secure, enabling a mobile-native user experience :iphone:

“SmartTokens” are traditional fungible and non fungible tokens that are extended with business logic, run natively inside the app and come with signed code to prevent tampering or phishing. It allows you to realise rich functions that Dapps previously struggled to implement. With SmartTokens you can get your token on iOS and Android in real time without the need to build your own ethereum wallet.

AlphaWallet is the “browser” for users to access these SmartTokens. You can get the most out of your use case implementation... without leaving the wallet.

Visit [TokenScript Documentation](https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript) or see [TokenScript Examples](https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TokenScript-Examples) to learn what you can do with it.
